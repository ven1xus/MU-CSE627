    "## Data fields \n",
    "- **DBNOs** - Number of enemy players knocked.\n",
    "- **assists** - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n",
    "- **boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n",
    "- **damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n",
    "- **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n",
    "- **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n",
    "- **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "- **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.)\n",
    "- **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n",
    "- **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n",
    "- **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n",
    "- **matchId** - Integer ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n",
    "- **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n",
    "- **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n",
    "- **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n",
    "- **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n",
    "- **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n",
    "- **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n",
    "- **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n",
    "- **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n",
    "- **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.)\n",
    "- **groupId** - Integer ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n",
    "- **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n",
    "- **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n",
    "- **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."
